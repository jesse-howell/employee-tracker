# employee-tracker

## Description

This is project is an employee tracker. I made this to practice creating a MySQL backend. The tracker is easy to use and solves the problem the user had for not having anything to track employees with. The database queries show a detailed breakdown of the organization. Unfortunately, the application has errors and is not fully functional at this time.
